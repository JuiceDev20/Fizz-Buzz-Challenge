Fizz-Buzz Challenge

Another great challenge from Coder Foundry, you are putting me through the paces but I am learning tons.

Good exercise to apply logic and work on looping functions. This a project that shows how fresh eyes can make the difference 
between 98% done and Complete! I would like to add, that most Palidrome examples you find only work with preassinged values.
This one works with user input, try it!

Anyway, hope you like using it and please feel free to share your thoughts.

Special thanks to Jason and Drew!
